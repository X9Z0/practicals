### 🧪 \*\*Aim:

To implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Python and reduce the dimensionality of a given dataset while preserving as much variance as possible.\*\*

---

### 📚 **Concept:**

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is an **unsupervised machine learning algorithm** used for **dimensionality reduction**. It transforms the original variables into a new set of variables called **principal components**, which are uncorrelated and capture the **maximum variance** in the data.

Key ideas:

- The first principal component has the **highest variance**.
- Each subsequent component has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the previous components.
- PCA helps with **visualization, noise reduction**, and speeding up learning algorithms.

### 🔬 **Procedure:**

1. **Import** necessary libraries.
2. **Generate or load** a dataset.
3. **Standardize** the features (important for PCA).
4. **Apply PCA** to reduce dimensions.
5. **Visualize** the reduced dataset.
6. **Interpret** the principal components.

### 🧑‍💻 **Python Code:**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Step 1: Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target
target_names = iris.target_names

# Step 2: Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Step 3: Apply PCA (reduce to 2 dimensions)
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)

# Step 4: Visualize the results
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
colors = ['r', 'g', 'b']
for i, target_name in enumerate(target_names):
    plt.scatter(X_pca[y == i, 0], X_pca[y == i, 1], alpha=0.7, color=colors[i], label=target_name)

plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')
plt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')
plt.title('PCA of IRIS Dataset')
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

---

### ✅ **Conclusion:**

The PCA algorithm was successfully implemented to reduce the dimensionality of the Iris dataset from 4 features to 2 principal components. The transformation retained the most significant variance in the data, making it easier to visualize and analyze patterns. PCA is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis, noise reduction, and speeding up other learning algorithms by simplifying the input space.
