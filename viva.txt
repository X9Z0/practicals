NumPy Viva Questions

1. What is NumPy?

NumPy stands for Numerical Python. It's a Python library used for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical operations.


---

2. What is an ndarray?

It’s NumPy’s main data structure—a powerful N-dimensional array object that supports vectorized operations (like element-wise addition).

import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])


---

3. Difference between Python list and NumPy array?


---

4. What is broadcasting?

Broadcasting lets NumPy perform operations on arrays of different shapes.

np.array([1, 2, 3]) + 5  # [6 7 8]


---

5. How to create arrays in NumPy?

np.zeros((2, 2))         # 2x2 array of 0s
np.ones((3,))            # 1D array of 1s
np.arange(0, 10, 2)      # [0 2 4 6 8]
np.linspace(0, 1, 5)     # 5 numbers between 0 and 1


---

6. Useful NumPy functions?

np.mean(), np.median(), np.std()

np.reshape(), np.transpose()

np.dot() for matrix multiplication



---

Pandas Viva Questions

1. What is Pandas?

Pandas is a data analysis and manipulation library. It provides easy-to-use structures: Series and DataFrame.


---

2. What is a Series and DataFrame?

Series: 1D labeled array


s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])

DataFrame: 2D table (rows & columns)


df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2], 'b': [3, 4]})


---

3. How to read and write data using Pandas?

df = pd.read_csv('file.csv')     # Read
df.to_csv('out.csv')             # Write


---

4. How to filter/select data?

df['column']                     # Select column
df[df['marks'] > 50]            # Filter rows
df.iloc[0:3]                     # By index
df.loc[:, ['name', 'age']]      # By labels


---

5. How to handle missing data?

df.isnull().sum()
df.dropna()                      # Drop missing
df.fillna(0)                     # Fill missing


---

6. How to perform group-by and aggregation?

df.groupby('department')['salary'].mean()


---

7. How to merge/join DataFrames?

pd.merge(df1, df2, on='id')
pd.concat([df1, df2])


---

Matplotlib Viva Questions

1. What is Matplotlib?

Matplotlib is a plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.


---

2. What is Pyplot?

matplotlib.pyplot is a module in Matplotlib. It provides functions to plot graphs quickly (like plt.plot(), plt.title() etc.).


---

3. Basic plot example

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [4, 5, 6]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("x-axis")
plt.ylabel("y-axis")
plt.show()


---

4. Other types of plots:

plt.bar() – bar chart

plt.hist() – histogram

plt.scatter() – scatter plot

plt.pie() – pie chart

plt.boxplot() – box plot



---

5. How to customize a plot?

plt.plot(x, y, color='red', marker='o', linestyle='--')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend(['Sales'])


---

6. How to show multiple plots in one figure?

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)   # 1 row, 2 columns, 1st plot
plt.plot(x, y)

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.bar(x, y)

plt.show()
