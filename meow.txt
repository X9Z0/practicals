Here’s a detailed yet viva-friendly breakdown of the key concepts you're asking about, plus a few extra ones that might come up in a Data Analysis and Visualization viva:


---

1. What is Time Series Analysis?

Definition: Time series analysis involves analyzing data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals (e.g., daily, monthly, quarterly).

Goal: Identify trends, patterns, seasonality, and forecast future values.

Examples: Stock prices, weather data, sales over time, etc.



---

2. What is ARIMA?

Full Form: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average.

Used For: Forecasting time series data.

Components:

AR (AutoRegression): Predicts value using past values (lags).

I (Integrated): Differencing the data to make it stationary (remove trends).

MA (Moving Average): Uses past forecast errors for prediction.


Notation: ARIMA(p, d, q)

p: number of AR terms

d: number of differences

q: number of MA terms

3. What is Covariance?

Definition: Covariance measures the relationship between two variables — how they change together.

Positive Covariance: Both variables increase together.

Negative Covariance: One increases, the other decreases.

Limitation: Covariance doesn't indicate the strength of the relationship — for that, we use correlation.



---

4. What is Correlation?

Definition: A standardized form of covariance that ranges between -1 and 1.

+1: Perfect positive correlation

-1: Perfect negative correlation

0: No correlation

Common methods: Pearson, Spearman



---

5. What is Stationarity in Time Series?

Stationary Series: A time series whose properties (mean, variance) do not change over time.

Required for ARIMA models.

Test: Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.



---

6. What is Data Visualization?

The process of representing data in visual formats like graphs, charts, maps, etc.

Goal: Make data easier to understand, identify patterns or outliers.



---

7. Common Visualization Types:

Line Chart: Time series data

Bar Chart: Categorical data

Histogram: Distribution of numerical data

Box Plot: Spread and outliers

Heatmap: Correlation matrix

Scatter Plot: Relationship between two variables



---

8. What is EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)?

The initial process of analyzing data to summarize its main characteristics.

Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Steps: Missing values, outliers, distribution, correlations, etc.



---

9. What is a Time Lag in Time Series?

A lag refers to previous values in a time series (e.g., Sales at time t-1).

Important in building ARIMA or other time-based models.



---

10. What is Moving Average?

A technique to smooth time series data by averaging over a fixed window.

Helps in reducing noise and identifying trend direction.
